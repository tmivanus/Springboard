    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "4-) Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.  \n",
    "The empirical difference between the rates of callbacks for w and b-sounding names is 0.032. In order to know if that difference is in fact statistically significant, I made two tests using bootstrap. The first test had the following null hypothesis: callbacks for w and b-sounding names come from the same distribution. Using permutation, I could observe that the probability of getting a difference equal or higher than the empirical difference under the null hypothesis was very small, so I could reject that hypothesis. The second test had the following null hypothesis: the rates of callbacks for w and b-sounding names are the same. That is a less restrictive hypothesis because I am not saying that callbacks are coming from the same distribution. By comparing 95% confidence intervals for each rate, I could observe that those intervals don't overlap and so I could reject the null hypothesis. Moreover, by also simulating the chance of getting a difference equal or lower than 0, I could observe a very small probability that allowed me to reject the null hypothesis. As a matter of fact, even the probability of getting a difference equal or smaller than 0.018 is small enough to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is a significant difference higher than zero between the rates of callbacks for w and b-sounding names, although that difference is most likely below 0.045. I don't have enough knowledge to say how big a difference must be to indicate racial bias. There is a difference suggesting racial bias nonetheless.\n",

    "5-) Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?  \n",
    "Here I am only analyzing the possible effect of w and b-sounding names in callback success. Other factors may also play a role in determining the callback success or altering how the names affect it. Without taking those other factors into account (using multiple regression, for example), I cannot say which factor is more important."
