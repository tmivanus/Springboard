Capstone 01: the variability of the medical practice.  
Updated on 12/19/2019

1-) Purpose.

The main purpose of the present study is to understand the role of specialty, locality and time
in explaining/predicting the variability of the medical practice in terms of number of patients,
visits and ambulatory surgeries. If the role of specialty, locality and time is weak, then other
factors such as moral hazard and supplier-induced demand may need to be investigated.

2-) Data.

The data comes from a sample of the database of a Colombian health insurance company.
Please, check the "original_data" directory. The data was originally divided into seven csv files:
- datos_ambulatorios_2008: doctor, specialty, patients, visits and ambulatory surgeries in 2008.
- datos_ambulatorios_2009: doctor, specialty, patients, visits and ambulatory surgeries in 2009.
- datos_ambulatorios_2010: doctor, specialty, patients, visits and ambulatory surgeries in 2010.
- datos_ambulatorios_2011: doctor, specialty, patients, visits and ambulatory surgeries in 2011.
- datos_ambulatorios_2012: doctor, specialty, patients, visits and ambulatory surgeries in 2012.
- datos_departamentos: doctor, year (2008-2012), locality (Colombian department).
- costos_promedios_ambulatorios: specialty, year (2008-2012), mean cost of visit and ambulatory surgery (USD).

"00_erase_doc_name_datos_ambulatorios_ano" code file removes the names of the doctors from 
the first five csv files, substituting them for identification codes in order to preserve 
data confidentiality. It creates five new csv files to replace those with confidentiality issues
(which obviously are not made available in the "original_data" directory for that reason):
- datos_ambulatorios_2008_new.
- datos_ambulatorios_2009_new.
- datos_ambulatorios_2010_new.
- datos_ambulatorios_2011_new.
- datos_ambulatorios_2012_new.  

"01_data_outpatient_years" code file organize the newly created five csv files into python
pandas dataframes, which are then saved in the "data" directory as the following csv files
(please, check the "data" directory):
- data_outpatient_2008.
- data_outpatient_2009.
- data_outpatient_2010.
- data_outpatient_2011.
- data_outpatient_2012.

"01_optional_data_outpatient_year_details" code file is optional in case the reader wishes to
see the tasks that are being performed in "01_data_outpatient_years" code file step-by-step
(just choose a year in the second cell). Otherwise, skip it.

"02_mean_outpatient_costs_usd" code file deals with the "costos_promedios_ambulatorios" csv file,
organizing it into a python pandas dataframe and saving it in the "data" directory as
"mean_outpatient_costs_usd" csv file. It also translates the specialty of each doctor from 
Spanish to English using Google Translate.

"03_data_departments" code file organizes the "datos_departamentos" csv file into a python 
pandas dataframe, saving it in the "data" directory as "data_departments" csv file.

"04_panel" code file put together all the previously created csv files in the "data" directory
to form a panel data. It concatenates all the "data_outpatient" files from 2008 to 2012 and then
merges it with "mean_outpatient_costs_usd" and "data_departments" files. The resulting panel data 
is saved in the "data" directory as "data_panel" csv file. It contains 8294 rows and 12 columns 
of information. 10 rows were discarded because of errors involving the doctorâ€™s specialty name or 
specialty identification code.

3-) First analyses.

"05_first_analyses" code file contains the first analyses using the abovementioned "data_panel" csv file.
Please, check the "data_panel" csv file in the "data" directory.
Because many medical specialties and departments (locations) don't have enough data, my suggestion was
to focus on 8 specialties and 9 departments that do have data for all years between 2008-2012.
Please, go to capstone_01_report for more details.

4-) Correlations.

"06_correlations" code file contains analyses involving correlations and statistical tests using 
bootstrap techniques. The focus is on a smaller subpanel (i.e., a subset of "data_panel" csv file in 
the "data" directory) containing 4 specialties, 2 departments and 5 years (2008-2012) that obeys the 
following condition: having more than 30 observations (doctors) for each specialty in each department 
in each year. The resulting subpanel has 2552 entries. In addition, the variable surgeries2visits is 
created to represent the ratio between number of surgeries and number of visits. Dummy variables
for each specialty and department are also created.
Please, go to capstone_01_report for more details.

5-) Final results.

"07_supervised_classification_and_regression" code file contains the final results of regressions and
supervised classifications for the abovementioned subpanel. Please, go to capstone_01_report for more 
details. The reader may also want to see the tables, graphs and explanations in the code file.
